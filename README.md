# Module-5 Parametric Statistical Analysis

In current practice, data analysis ends with an assessment of statistical significance. In this module we'll look at some of the more established methods (ANOVA), which you'll need to know to understand the published literature, as well as some improved methods (linear mixed effects models).

## Objectives

At the end of the module you will be able toÂ 

- Perform traditional T-tests and ANOVAs in Matlab
- Explain the computations underlying the ANOVA
- Use Monte Carlo simulations to probe the properties of a statistical test.
- Use linear mixed effects models for common experimental designs in neuroscience.
- Be able to explain why mixed effects models are better than traditional ANOVA

## Materials

1. Start by reading and exploring code that helps understand the basics of the traditional analyses of variance in the following MLX files:
  - `./docs/onesample.mlx`
  - `./docs/twosample.mlx`
  - `./docs/anova.mlx`
1. Llinear mixed models are a more modern and better approach, that you should  use in your own projects. Two MLX explain the basics (and the relation with the traditional methods) and some more advanced use cases:

  - `./docs/linearmixedmodels.mlx`
  - `./docs/linearmixedmodelspart2.mlx`
1. While working through the Linear Mixed Models MLX file, this video may be helpful to help interpret the output of fitlme.
1. After completing the Linear Mixed Models assignments (below) the `./docs/linearmixedmodelspart3.mlx` helps to understand how to use the model to make predictions and how to compare model parameters with each other.
1. This discusses  linear mixed effects models on a conceptual level.
